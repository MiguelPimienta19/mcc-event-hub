2. Feature Breakdown by Zone
Zone A: Public Events Portal (Next.js Server Components)

Event Feed (Home):
List of upcoming events sorted by date.
Feature: "Add to Google Calendar" button for each event.
Event Detail Page:
Dynamic Route: /events/[id].
SEO: Server-rendered Open Graph tags (so link previews look good on Instagram/iMessage).

Zone B: Admin Dashboard (Next.js Client Components)
Goal: Interactivity. Requires Login.
Admin Access Gate (The "Login" Screen):
UI: A clean, centered screen (as per your design) asking for "Admin Email."
Flow: User enters email -> System checks if email exists in profiles table -> If yes, sends Magic Link or Password prompt -> Redirects to Dashboard.
Security: Protects the dashboard from unauthorized access.
Admin User Management (New Feature):
Capability: Existing admins can invite new student leaders to become admins.
Actions: * Add Admin: Enter an email to grant access.
Delete Admin: Remove access for past members.
View: A simple list of current authorized admins.
Event Management (CRUD):

Functionality: Admins can add raw topics/bullet points to a specific meeting slot.
Storage: Agenda items are saved to Supabase linked to the specific Event ID.
The "MCC Assistant" Chatbot:
A floating chat widget in the dashboard.
Interface: Simple chat UI (User message -> AI response).


3. The "AI" Features (Python Backend Power)
This is where your FastAPI backend shines.
Feature 1: The "Event Architect" Chatbot
Problem: Student leaders struggle to write engaging event descriptions or professional emails.
Solution: A chatbot that acts as a PR assistant.
User Prompt: "We are hosting a gala on Friday with food and music. Write a catchy Instagram caption and a formal email to faculty."
Backend Logic: FastAPI receives text -> Calls OpenAI (GPT-4o) -> Returns structured JSON with instagram_caption and email_body.
Feature 2: AI Agenda Optimizer (New Feature)
Problem: Meetings are disorganized; students have too many topics and run over time.
Solution: An AI agent that takes a raw list of topics and organizes them into a time-boxed schedule.
User Flow: 1. Admin types raw list: "Budget approval, Gala planning, new member welcome." 2. Admin clicks "Optimize Agenda." 3. Backend Logic: FastAPI sends list to OpenAI with prompt: "Organize these into a 60-minute efficient meeting flow." 4. Output: A structured timeline (e.g., "0:00-0:10: Welcome", "0:10-0:30: Gala Planning").
Feature 3: Conflict Detection
Problem: Two clubs booking the same room at the same time.
Solution: When an Admin creates an event, the Python backend checks the database for overlaps.
Logic: if (new_event.time overlaps existing_event.time): return Warning.
